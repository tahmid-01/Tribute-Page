    <h2>The Life of a Genius</h2>
    <p>Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and author who is widely recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians and scientists of all time.</p>
    
    <h3>Major Scientific Achievements and Contributions:</h3>
    
    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Laws of Motion (1687)</h4>
        <p>Formulated three fundamental laws of motion, forming the basis of classical mechanics, published in Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica ("The Principia").</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Law of Universal Gravitation (1687)</h4>
        <p>Described the force of gravity and its universal application, published in The Principia.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Development of Calculus (mid-1660s – early 1670s)</h4>
        <p>Co-developed calculus independently, though its publication and priority disputes arose later with Leibniz.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Reflecting Telescope (1668)</h4>
        <p>Invented the first practical reflecting telescope using a parabolic mirror, improving optical clarity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Decomposition of Light (1665–1672)</h4>
        <p>Demonstrated that white light is composed of the spectrum of colors using a prism, detailed in Opticks (1704).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Binomial Theorem Generalization (1665)</h4>
        <p>Generalized the binomial theorem for any rational exponent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Newton's Cooling Law (1701)</h4>
        <p>Proposed a law describing the rate of heat loss in objects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Corpuscular Theory of Light (1672)</h4>
        <p>Proposed that light is composed of particles or "corpuscles," a concept explored in Opticks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Study of Alchemy and Chemistry</h4>
        <p>Conducted extensive, though secretive, studies on alchemy and chemical transformations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Work on Fluid Mechanics (1687)</h4>
        <p>Formulated principles governing fluid motion in The Principia, influencing later hydrodynamics.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Academic and Professional Positions:</h3>
    
    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge (1669)</h4>
        <p>Appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="achievement">
        <h4>Master of the Royal Mint (1699)</h4>
        <p>Reformed England's coinage and combated counterfeiting.</p>
    </div>
